# md-from-notion

Little helper which makes 2 things:
1. Remove generated ids from markdown files [exported](https://www.notion.so/help/export-your-content) from [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)
2. Ignore all csv files
3. If "Created" field exist in document sets md document creation date to the same value

This can be useful if you need raw markdown (for example for [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) import)

Actually this is just my first trainee project in Go.
And the only reason why it exists is desire to try to write some Go code. :)
